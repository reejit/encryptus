## Caesar Encode

`/caesar{type}e` <plain>, There are 26 types of the caesar cipher, the function returns a string with the encoded text, the difference between the types is just the shift. The action of a Caesar cipher is to replace each plaintext letter with a different one a fixed number of places down the alphabet. The cipher illustrated here uses a left shift of three, so that (for example) each occurrence of E in the plaintext becomes B in the ciphertext.
